# Apeirophobia_Scripts
This is just for FREE apeirophobia scripts!

First script

Is used for teleports! But sadly only thoose levels work in this script. (0,1,2,3,4,5,6,8,9) -- thoose are the only working level teleports!


Second script
---
Gives you All gamepasses for free! (you need to execute the script before loading and if you don't have the gamepasses just reset your character)
and if you want increased lobby just execute the script in the main menu and then go to your backpack and then click on "Active" in the gamepass increased lobby and then
Re-Activate it again!


Third Script
---
Probably the best of all scripts!
has Xray also full bright and also Infinite lives and also infinite stamina also for key,button,entity esp! and dont forget you can also teleport to other players!
entity radar and also you can change the theme of the GUI!
